# Automated End-to-End Custom Model Builder

**A Deep Learning-based system that automates custom dataset creation, annotation, training, and inference for object detection using YOLOv8.**

This project allows users to create custom datasets, automatically annotate images, train YOLO models, and test detection on images and videos with minimal manual effort.

## Problem

Creating and training object detection models from scratch requires:

- Manual dataset annotation (time-consuming and error-prone)
- Dataset preparation
- Model training setup
- Testing and evaluation

This process is challenging for non-experts and slows down experimentation and prototyping.

---

## Solution

- **Automated dataset creation and annotation** for any custom object class.
- **Custom YOLOv8 model training** with minimal dataset for quick experimentation.
- **Inference on images and videos** using the trained model.
- Web interface for smooth interaction without coding.
- Efficient transfer learning using pretrained YOLO models.

---

## Outcome / Impact

- Fully automated **dataset creation and model training** pipeline.
- Rapid prototyping of custom object detection models.
- Clear **performance metrics** for trained models.
- Portfolio-ready demonstration of end-to-end AI model development.

---

## Key Features

- Automatic annotation of uploaded images for custom classes.
- YOLOv8 training on custom datasets.
- Test inference on both images and videos.
- Store and manage trained models dynamically.
- Minimal dataset approach with transfer learning.
